## Project Sprint 2: Nov. 25, 2020 <a name="sprint"></a>

- TODO: Complete/edit list on Trello. Create a list of tasks required to implement your project. Please note that the tasks should include all the tasks required to get this app created and tested.
  - Our Trello board has three columns (To Do, In Progress, and Done). Each task is assigned to one or more group members and includes deliverables and due date. 
  
### App Description & Use Cases
- Chatroom app that provides translation options within the chatroom to speak with users of another language, and alternate translation features (i.e. talk-to-speech, talk-to-text, text-to-speech, text-to-text) outside of the chatroom
- Airports & taxi companies
- Pen pals
- Foreign exchange students
- Education/language immersion

### App Features 

- Chatroom app that provides translation options
- Translates text to speech, speech to text, between languages and visual text, speech to speech.
- Long press on chatroom message and select a language for translation
- Change app settings to preferred language and auto-translate

### Users
- We predict travel and education industries will want to use our app. 
- Many apps have similar functionality, but ours will combine features in a new way. For example, Google Translate has translation, and WhatsApp has chat rooms, but our app will combine the two

### Permissions and Sensors
- Location permission to predict language based on country/region.
- Microphone permission for speech.

### App Monetization Ideas
- Sponsors can run ad banners or play short videos 
- Subscription for advanced features: The basic model includes text-to-text translation between different languages. The advanced model includes speech-to-text translation as well as options to have auto translation turned on for the chat room.
- Targeted marketing for travel and education industries.
